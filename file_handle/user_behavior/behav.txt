1. Data Overview and Cleaning
Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing or null values in each column.
Data Types: Verify that each column is in the correct data type (e.g., categorical columns like 'Device Model' should be of type object, 'App Usage Time' should be numeric).
Remove or Treat Outliers: Identify outliers in continuous columns, like 'App Usage Time (min/day)', 'Battery Drain (mAh/day)', and 'Data Usage (MB/day)', which could skew your analysis.
2. Descriptive Statistics
Summary Statistics: Use df.describe() to get basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
Distribution of Age and Gender: Plot histograms to understand the age distribution and gender breakdown.
3. Behavioral Patterns Analysis
Usage and Battery Drain Patterns: Calculate average 'App Usage Time' and 'Battery Drain' per device model and operating system to see how device type impacts usage and battery consumption.
Screen Time vs. App Usage: Check if thereâ€™s a correlation between 'Screen On Time' and 'App Usage Time' to see if higher app usage results in more screen time.
User Behavior Classes: Analyze the distribution of the 'User Behavior Class' to understand user types and see if certain classes have distinct patterns in usage, battery drain, or data consumption.
4. Device and OS Analysis
Device Popularity: Calculate and plot the frequency of each 'Device Model' to see which models are most popular.
Operating System Differences: Compare Android and iOS users in terms of 'Battery Drain', 'App Usage Time', and 'Data Usage' to explore OS-related behavior.
5. Correlation Analysis
Correlation Matrix: Use df.corr() to get a correlation matrix, focusing on relationships between variables like 'App Usage Time', 'Battery Drain', 'Data Usage', and 'Number of Apps Installed'.
Heatmap: Plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix to visually identify strong correlations.
6. Demographic Analysis
Age Group Analysis: Segment users into age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.) and examine differences in usage patterns, battery drain, and data usage across age groups.
Gender Comparison: Compare 'App Usage Time', 'Battery Drain', and other key metrics between genders to identify any behavioral differences.
7. Cluster Analysis (Optional)
Use clustering techniques like K-Means to group users into distinct segments based on their behavior metrics. This could reveal clusters with unique combinations of 'App Usage Time', 'Battery Drain', etc.
8. Visualization
Bar and Pie Charts: Use bar charts to show categorical data like 'Device Model' and 'Operating System' distributions and pie charts for gender proportions.
Boxplots: For variables like 'App Usage Time' and 'Battery Drain', use boxplots to show distributions and identify outliers.
Scatter Plots: Scatter plots of 'Screen On Time' vs. 'App Usage Time' or 'Battery Drain' vs. 'App Usage Time' can show any visible correlations.
