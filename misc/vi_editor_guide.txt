### 1. Opening vi and Writing a Script
1. To start editing a file, open your WSL terminal and type:
   ```bash
   vi filename.py
   ```
   If the file doesn’t exist, `vi` will create a new file with that name.

2. You will be in **Normal Mode** by default. To start typing, press `i` to enter **Insert Mode**.

3. Write your Python script or text.

### 2. Saving Your Work
1. After you finish writing, save the file by first exiting Insert Mode:
   - Press `Esc` to leave Insert Mode and return to Normal Mode.

2. To save and quit the file:
   - Type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

   Alternatively:
   - To save without quitting, type `:w` and press `Enter`.
   - Then type `:q` to quit if you’re done.

### 3. Re-opening and Editing the Saved File
1. Open the file again if you closed it:
   ```bash
   vi filename.py
   ```

2. To make changes:
   - Navigate to the part you want to edit using the arrow keys (or `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
   - Press `i` to enter **Insert Mode** and start editing.

3. After making your changes:
   - Press `Esc` to return to **Normal Mode**.
   - Save and quit by typing `:wq`.

### Additional Commands
- `:w`: Save changes without quitting.
- `:q`: Quit `vi`.
- `:q!`: Quit without saving changes.
- `u`: Undo the last change (in Normal Mode).
- `/text`: Search for "text" within the file.
